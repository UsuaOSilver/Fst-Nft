What I learn:
- How BAYC, CryptoPunk, NounsDAO design their smart contracts. These are some of the A+ projects with strong security guarantees, secured metadata, creativity, and elegance according to the (NFT smart contract rating)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vv1FNTSgIlAyeOg7lIYyChy9b9XYHJlS-spA7vYSSgk/edit#gid=0] of the CTO of RTFKT, (Samuel Cardillo)[http://twitter.com/CardilloSamuel]
- The pros and cons of different ERC721 implementations from OppenZeppelin (ERC721 OP), Rari Capital (ERC721 solmate) and the Azuki team (ERC721A).
- Implement the ERC721 OP standard contract, it's utilities and extensions.
- Write overloading functions
- Implement safety features using `_safeMint()`
- Upload png files to IPFS through Pinata and generate metadata files for each NFT automatically.
- Build and deploy a Hardhat project from scratch with the help of Hardhat doc
- The importance of commenting and documenting (coding best practices)
